/**
 * DOT adapter for `@arki/event-sourcing`.
 *
 * Wraps `eventSourcingFeatures.initEventSourcing` + `initMessageBus` as a
 * single `DotPip`. The pip opens the PostgreSQL event store in
 * `boot`, attaches command handlers to an in-memory message bus, publishes
 * both as `services.eventStore` and `services.messageBus`, and closes the
 * event store pool in `dispose` (reverse-topological order).
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { defineApp } from '@arki/dot';
 * import { eventSourcing } from '@arki/event-sourcing/dot';
 *
 * const app = await defineApp('my-app')
 *   .use(eventSourcing({
 *     projections: [orderProjection, invoiceProjection],
 *     commandHandlers: [placeOrderHandler, cancelOrderHandler],
 *   }))
 *   .boot();
 *
 * await app.services.messageBus.send({ type: 'PlaceOrder', payload: { ... } });
 * await app.dispose();
 * ```
 *
 * The connection URL is resolved in this order:
 *   1. `options.dbUrl` if provided
 *   2. `process.env.EVENT_STORE_URL`
 *   3. `process.env.EVENTSTORE_URL`
 *   4. `process.env.EVENT_DB_URL`
 *
 * If none are set, `boot` throws with a message naming every accepted env
 * var — same contract as `eventSourcingFeatures.initEventSourcing`.
 *
 * The `@arki/dot` package is an OPTIONAL peer of `@arki/event-sourcing`.
 * Importing this adapter without `@arki/dot` installed will fail at module
 * load — that is intentional: the adapter only makes sense in a DOT app.
